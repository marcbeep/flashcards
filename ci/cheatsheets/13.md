## 🧬 **Genetic Programming (GP)** – Overview

**GP** is a method where computers evolve programs (solutions) automatically using biological ideas like selection, crossover, and mutation.

- Instead of just adjusting values (like Genetic Algorithms), GP changes both:

  - The **structure** (form) of the program,
  - And the **parameters** (numbers/inputs) in it.

---

## 🌳 **GP Representation**

- Programs are represented as **trees**:

  - **Functions** go in the **branches** (e.g., `+`, `*`, `if`, `sin`)
  - **Terminals** (numbers or variables) go in the **leaves**

- Example Tree:
  `(2 + N) × 4`
  Looks like:

  ```
      ×
     / \
    +   4
   / \
  2   N
  ```

---

## 🧱 GP Components

### Terminal Set (T):

- Endpoints of trees.
- Could be constants (like `2`) or variables (like `x`, `y`).

### Function Set (F):

- Internal nodes like `+`, `-`, `*`, `if`, `loop`, `sin`, etc.
- Should be small (for speed) but expressive (for solving problems).

---

## ⚙️ GP Operators

### 1. **Selection**:

- Pick better programs to survive or mate (based on fitness).

### 2. **Crossover**:

- Swap parts (subtrees) of two programs to create new ones.

### 3. **Mutation**:

- Randomly change one function or terminal in a tree.

### GP Flow (Loop):

1. While the population isn't full:

   - Decide to mutate or crossover.
   - If mutate: pick 1, change a part.
   - If crossover: pick 2, swap parts.
   - Add to new generation.

2. Repeat for many generations.

## 🌱 Tree Initialization Methods

### 1. **Full Method**:

- All branches go to max depth (`Dmax`).
- Functions inside, terminals at the end.

### 2. **Grow Method**:

- Varying depths.
- Mixed functions and terminals inside.

### 3. **Ramped Half-and-Half**:

- Mix of Full and Grow to get diverse trees.

## ❌ Introns in GP

**Introns** are parts of the program that **do nothing**.

- Example: an unused `if` statement.
- They can:

  - ✅ Protect good parts from bad crossover
  - ❌ Make programs longer, slower, and harder to understand

### Controlling Introns:

- Penalize complex programs using:

  - Node count
  - Instruction count
  - CPU load

## 🧠 Gene Expression Programming (GEP)

GEP is similar to GP but uses **fixed-length strings (like DNA)** to represent programs.

### Genotype vs Phenotype:

- **Genotype** = the gene string (e.g., `Q * + - a b c d`)
- **Phenotype** = the tree it decodes into

### Decoding:

- Read the string left to right
- Fill the tree level-by-level
- Use each function’s required number of inputs

---

## 💡 GEP Encoding Example:

Math formula:

```
√((a + b) × (c − d))
```

GEP gene string:

```
Q * + - a b c d
```

Turns into tree:

```
       Q
       |
       *
     /   \
    +     -
   / \   / \
  a   b c   d
```

---

## ✨ GEP Advantages over GP

1. **Fixed-length strings** (easier to manage)
2. **Always valid programs** (no broken trees)
3. **Non-coding regions** (help mutation/crossover without damage)

### Head and Tail:

- **Head**: can have functions and terminals
- **Tail**: only terminals
- Example:

  ```
  + Q - / b * a a Q b a  a b b a
  ```

---

## 🔁 GEP Mutation Example

Original gene:

```
+ Q - / b * a a Q **b** a  a b b a
```

Mutate `"b"` → `"+"` (a function from head set)

Result:

```
+ Q - / b * a a Q **+** a  a b b a
```

This mutation changes the structure of the resulting tree and increases its depth.

---

## 🔀 GEP Crossover Example

Parent 1:

```
- b + Q b b a b b / a Q b b b a a b
```

Parent 2:

```
/ - a / a b a b b - b a - a b a a a
```

Cut and swap after a point:

Child 1:

```
- b + / a b a b b - b a - a b a a a
```

Child 2:

```
/ - a Q b b a b b / a Q b b b a a b
```

This introduces **diversity**, but may disrupt useful structures.

## 📊 GEP in Symbolic Regression

Goal: Find this function using basic math (no `^` allowed):

```
f(a) = a⁴ + a³ + a² + a
```

GEP finds:

```
* + + / * * a a a a a a a a
```

Which builds this tree:

```
       *
     /   \
    +     +
   / \   / \
  /   * *   a
 a a a a a a
```

This results in:

```
(1 + a²) × (a + a²) = a + a² + a³ + a⁴
```

🎉 Perfect match!
