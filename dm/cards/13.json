    "q": "What steps are followed in extrinsic clustering evaluation using ground truth labels?",
    "a": "- Assign each cluster the most common label within it.\n- Merge clusters with the same label.\n- Calculate Precision, Recall, and F-score for each label.\n- Compute the macro-average of these metrics across all labels."
