    "a": "- Actors: entities like people or organizations.\n- Relationships: interactions or links between actors.\n- Represented as a graph: \\( G = (V, E) \\)\n  - \\( V \\): set of nodes (actors)\n  - \\( E \\): set of edges (relationships)"

    "q": "What can be analyzed in a social network graph?",
    "a": "- Structural properties\n- Central or influential nodes\n- Critical nodes\n- Community detection\n- Abnormal substructures\n- Link prediction\n- Social influence"

    "q": "What are the main types of centrality and prestige measures?",

    "a": "- Measures node's direct connections in undirected graphs.\n- Formula:\n\\[ \\mathbf{CD(i)} = \\frac{\\text{deg}(i)}{n - 1} \\]\n- \\( \\text{deg}(i) \\): number of links for node \\( i \\)\n- Higher degree = more central/hub-like"

    "a": "- Uses only local information.\n- Ignores nodes beyond immediate neighbors.\n- May misidentify global importance."

    "a": "- Measures how close a node is to all others in the graph.\n- Based on average shortest path distance:\n\\[ \\mathbf{AvDist(i)} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j \\neq i} \\text{dist}(i, j)}{n - 1} \\]\n\\[ \\mathbf{CC(i)} = \\frac{1}{\\text{AvDist}(i)} \\]\n- Smaller \\( \\text{AvDist}(i) \\) means higher \\( CC(i) \\)"

    "q": "What is Betweenness Centrality and how is it calculated?",
    "a": "- Measures how often a node lies on shortest paths between others.\n- Reflects control over communication.\n- Formula:\n\\[ \\mathbf{CB(i)} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j < k} f_{jk}(i)}{\\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}} \\]\n- \\( f_{jk}(i) = \\frac{q_{jk}(i)}{q_{jk}} \\): fraction of paths from \\( j \\) to \\( k \\) passing through \\( i \\)"
  },
  {
    "q": "What are key properties and uses of Betweenness Centrality?",
    "a": "- Ranges from 0 to 1\n- High values = node is a bridge or gatekeeper\n- Can be extended to edges\n- Used in community detection (e.g., Girvanâ€“Newman algorithm)"

    "q": "What is Degree Prestige in a directed graph?",
    "a": "- Based on number of incoming links (in-degree).\n- Reflects popularity or importance.\n- Formula:\n\\[ \\mathbf{PD(i)} = \\frac{\\text{deg}^+(i)}{n - 1} \\]\n- \\( \\text{deg}^+(i) \\): in-degree of node \\( i \\)"

  {
    "q": "Why is Proximity Prestige better than using inverse average distance alone?",
    "a": "- Avoids favoring nodes with small but close influence sets.\n- Combines how many nodes can reach the target and how close they are.\n- Ensures fairness by using a multiplicative adjustment."
