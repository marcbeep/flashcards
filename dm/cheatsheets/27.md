## Social Network Analysis (SNA): Centrality and Prestige

### Basic Concepts

- **Actors**: The individuals or entities in a network (like people, organizations).
- **Relationships**: Interactions between actors, forming connections or edges in a graph.
- **Graph Representation**: A social network is shown as a graph **G = (V, E)**, where:

  - **V** = set of nodes (actors),
  - **E** = set of edges (relationships).

---

## Why Analyze Networks?

We use networks to:

- Understand structure
- Identify key/central actors
- Find critical connectors
- Detect communities
- Find unusual patterns
- Predict new connections
- Study influence spread

## Centrality Measures (for undirected graphs)

Centrality tells us which nodes are most important.

### 1. **Degree Centrality (CD)**

- **Definition**: Number of connections a node has, normalized by the maximum possible (which is _n – 1_ where _n_ is the number of nodes).

  **Formula**:

  $$
  CD(i) = \frac{\text{deg}(i)}{n - 1}
  $$

  - **deg(i)** = number of direct connections (degree) of node _i_
  - Nodes with high degree often act as **hubs**.

- **Limitation**: Only local view – doesn't consider the broader network.

---

### 2. **Closeness Centrality (CC)**

- Measures how close a node is to all other nodes (based on shortest paths).

- Nodes with smaller average distance to others have higher closeness.

  **Formula**:

  $$
  CC(i) = \frac{1}{AvDist(i)} = \frac{1}{\frac{\sum_{j \neq i} \text{dist}(i, j)}{n - 1}}
  $$

  - **dist(i, j)** = shortest path distance between _i_ and _j_

- **High CC** = fast access to all parts of the network.

---

### 3. **Betweenness Centrality (CB)**

- Captures how often a node appears on shortest paths between other pairs of nodes.

- Reflects **control over information flow**.

  **Formula**:

  $$
  CB(i) = \frac{\sum_{j < k} f_{jk}(i)}{\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}}
  $$

  where:

  - $q_{jk}$ = number of shortest paths between _j_ and _k_
  - $q_{jk}(i)$ = number of those paths that pass through _i_
  - $f_{jk}(i) = \frac{q_{jk}(i)}{q_{jk}}$

- High CB = node is a **bridge** between groups.

- **Can be extended to edges**, identifying **bridging edges** in community detection (e.g. Girvan-Newman algorithm).

---

## Prestige Measures (for directed graphs)

Used when relationships have direction (e.g., who follows whom).

### 1. **Degree Prestige (PD)**

- Based on **in-degree**: how many incoming links a node has.

  **Formula**:

  $$
  PD(i) = \frac{\text{deg}^+(i)}{n - 1}
  $$

  - **deg⁺(i)** = number of incoming links to _i_

- High in-degree = more **popular** or **respected**.

---

### 2. **Proximity Prestige (PP)**

- Considers how many nodes can reach a given node, and how far they are.

  Definitions:

  - **Influence(i)** = set of nodes that can reach _i_
  - **AvDist(i)** = average distance from all nodes in **Influence(i)** to node _i_

    $$
    AvDist(i) = \frac{\sum_{j \in Influence(i)} \text{dist}(j, i)}{|Influence(i)|}
    $$

  - **InfluenceFraction(i)** =

    $$
    \frac{|Influence(i)|}{n - 1}
    $$

  **Final formula**:

  $$
  PP(i) = \frac{InfluenceFraction(i)}{AvDist(i)}
  $$

- Fixes the issue of closeness-style measures favoring nodes with small influence sets.

- **Higher PP** = node is reachable by many and from shorter distances.
