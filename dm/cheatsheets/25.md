## ðŸ“Š Introduction to Graph Mining

Graph mining is a field that focuses on analyzing and understanding data that naturally forms networks or graph structures. These graphs appear in many real-world systems, such as:

- **Air Transportation Networks**: Airports as nodes, flights as edges.
- **Social Networks**: People as nodes, friendships/interactions as edges.
- **Cattle Movement Networks**: Farms as nodes, animal movements as edges.
- **Email Exchange Networks**: People as nodes, email communications as edges.
- **Program Flow Graphs**: Program components as nodes, control flow as edges.
- **Chemical Reaction Networks**: Molecules/reactions as nodes, interactions as edges.
- **Power Networks (Electrical Grids)**: Power stations and substations as nodes, transmission lines as edges.
- **Molecular Graphs (Chemical Graphs)**: Atoms as nodes, chemical bonds as edges.

Each of these examples involves a set of **entities** (nodes) and **relationships or interactions** (edges).

## ðŸ“Œ Key Topics in Graph Mining

1. **Graph Classification**

   - Assign a label or category to an entire graph.
   - Example: Classifying molecules as toxic or non-toxic based on their structure.

2. **Graph Clustering**

   - Group similar graphs or nodes within a graph.
   - Useful for finding similar users, communities, or similar molecules.

3. **Graph Pattern Mining**

   - Discover frequently occurring subgraphs or structures.
   - Example: Identifying common interaction patterns in proteins.

4. **Graph Compression**

   - Reduce the size of the graph while retaining its structure.
   - Helps with storage and speeding up analysis.

5. **Graph Dynamics**

   - Study how a graph changes over time.
   - Important for tracking evolving networks like social media or financial transactions.

6. **Social Network Analysis**

   - Study relationships and influence in social graphs.
   - Tasks include finding influential people, communities, or viral spread patterns.

7. **Graph Visualization**

   - Creating visual representations of graphs to understand structure and patterns.

8. **Link Analysis**

   - Study relationships and predict new connections.
   - Example: Recommending friends or products.

## ðŸ§ª Two Common Settings in Graph Mining

### 1. **Database of Many Small Graphs**

- **Use case examples**:

  - Chemical compounds (each compound is a separate graph).
  - Program flow graphs from software.

- **Tasks**:

  - Graph classification: e.g., classifying compounds by activity.
  - Pattern mining: finding substructures that appear frequently.
  - Clustering: grouping similar graphs.

### 2. **A Single Large Graph**

- **Use case examples**:

  - The web (pages as nodes, links as edges).
  - Social networks (people and relationships).
  - Transportation systems.

- **Tasks**:

  - Community detection: identifying tightly connected groups.
  - Influential node identification: finding key individuals (e.g., influencers).
  - Node ranking: like Google's PageRank, ranking web pages.
  - Link prediction: predicting which nodes might connect in the future.
