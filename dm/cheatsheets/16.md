## **k-Medians Algorithm Overview**

The **k-Medians algorithm** is a _representative-based clustering method_, where the goal is to split a dataset into **k clusters** such that the total **Manhattan (L1) distance** between the data points and their assigned cluster representative is minimized.
---

## **1. Representative-Based Clustering**

Let:

- **k** = number of clusters
- **D = {X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ}** be the dataset
- We want to find **k representatives Y₁, ..., Yₖ** (not necessarily in the dataset)

**Objective:**
Minimize the total distance of each point to its closest representative:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \min_{j} d(X_i, Y_j)
$$

Where **d(X, Y)** is a distance function.

## **2. General k-Representative Clustering Approach**

Steps:

1. **Initialisation**: Choose k initial representatives.
2. **Iterative Refinement**:

   - **Assign step**: Assign each data point to its nearest representative using the distance function.
   - **Optimize step**: Update each representative to minimize the total distance within its cluster.

---

## **3. k-Means (for Comparison)**

In **k-Means**, the distance function used is **squared Euclidean distance**:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{X \in C_i} \|X - Y_i\|^2
$$

- $C_i$ is the i-th cluster.
- The optimal representative for each cluster is the **mean** (centroid) of the points in that cluster.

**How to find it:**

$$
Y_i = \frac{1}{|C_i|} \sum_{X \in C_i} X
$$

---

## **4. k-Medians (Main Focus)**

Instead of Euclidean distance, **k-Medians uses the Manhattan distance (L1 distance)**:

$$
\|X - Y\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^d |x_i - y_i|
$$

The goal becomes:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{X \in C_i} \|X - Y_i\|_1
$$

## **5. Finding the Optimal Representative in k-Medians**

Assume a fixed cluster **C**, and want to find the best representative **Y** to minimize:

$$
\sum_{X \in C} \|X - Y\|_1
$$

If:

- Each point $X \in \mathbb{R}^d$ has coordinates $X = (X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, ..., X^{(d)})$
- The optimal Y will be $Y = (Y^{(1)}, ..., Y^{(d)})$ where each $Y^{(i)}$ is the **median** of the i-th coordinates of all points in the cluster.

**Why?**
Because minimizing L1 distance means choosing the **median** in each coordinate:

$$
Y^{(i)} = \text{median}(X_1^{(i)}, X_2^{(i)}, ..., X_s^{(i)})
$$

This ensures the sum of absolute differences is minimized.

## **6. Summary of the k-Medians Algorithm**

**Input**:

- Dataset: $D = \{X_1, ..., X_n\}$
- Number of clusters: $k$

**Steps**:

1. **Initialisation**: Choose $k$ representatives randomly from the dataset.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to its closest representative using L1 distance.
3. **Optimisation**: For each cluster, update the representative to be the **median** of all points in the cluster (coordinate-wise).
4. **Repeat steps 2–3** until:

   - No data point changes its cluster, or
   - A fixed number of iterations is reached.
