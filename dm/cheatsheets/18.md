## **Hierarchical Clustering**

### **Key Features**

- **No need to specify the number of clusters** in advance.
- **Builds a hierarchy of clusters**, giving clusterings at all levels of granularity.
- Useful for **visualising data structures** and organizing data into nested groups or concepts.

### **Hierarchy of Clusters**

Clusters can be nested like this:

- Start with: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- Then: `{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}`
- Then: `{1, 2}, {3}, {4, 5}`
- Finally: `{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}`

This shows how clusters split up step-by-step.

### **Dendrogram**

A **dendrogram** is a tree-like diagram used to visualize the hierarchy.

- The **bottom** shows individual items.
- As you go **up**, items get merged into clusters.
- The **height** at which two items merge shows how similar (or distant) they are — lower height means more similar.

### **Real-World Applications**

#### **1. Phylogenetic Trees (Evolutionary Biology)**

Steps to build a phylogenetic tree:

1. Generate DNA sequences for different species.
2. Calculate **edit distances** between sequences (i.e. how many changes it takes to turn one into another).
3. Use these distances to compute **similarities**.
4. Build a tree showing evolutionary relationships.

This helps chart how species evolved over time.

#### **2. Tracking Viruses**

- Viruses like **HIV** mutate quickly.
- DNA similarities between viral samples can be used to **trace transmission paths**.
- Example: Used in a court case to show the victim's virus was more similar to a suspect’s than to a control group.

**Visual example:**

- V1–V3: Victim’s strands
- P1–P3: Patient’s (accused) strands
- LA1–LA12: Control group strands
  Dendrograms can show that V and P group more closely than LA, suggesting a link.

#### **3. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Phylogeny**

- Hierarchical clustering was used to track the **Omicron variant's spread and evolution**.
- Helped scientists understand how the variant differed from others.

### **Two Main Types of Hierarchical Clustering**

#### **1. Agglomerative Clustering (Bottom-Up)**

- **Start with each data point as its own cluster.**
- At each step, **merge the two closest clusters**.
- Repeat until all points are merged into one cluster.
- Most commonly used.

#### **2. Divisive Clustering (Top-Down)**

- **Start with one big cluster** containing all points.
- At each step, **split the cluster** into smaller groups.
- Continue until each item is in its own cluster.
