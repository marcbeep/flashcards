## Graph Theory Basics

A **graph** consists of:
  - A set of **nodes (vertices)**: Represent entities (like airports in a network).
  - A set of **edges (links)**: Represent relationships or connections between nodes.

  ### Terms:

  - Two nodes are **adjacent** if there's an edge between them.
  - An edge is **incident** on its two endpoint nodes.
  - Graphs are usually drawn with:
      - Circles for nodes
      - Lines for edges

## Types of Graphs

### 1. **Undirected Graph**:

- Edges have no direction.
- (u, v) = (v, u): Edge from u to v is the same as from v to u.

### 2. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**:

- Edges have direction (called **arcs**).
- (u, v) ≠ (v, u): Edge from u to v is different from v to u.

### 3. **Multigraph**:

- Multiple edges are allowed between the same pair of nodes.

### 4. **Loop**:

- An edge that connects a node to itself (u, u).

## Weighted Graphs

- **Edge-weighted**: Each edge has a number (weight), e.g., cost, distance, strength of connection.
- **Vertex-weighted**: Each node has a weight, representing something like importance or size.

## Adjacency Matrix

A matrix representation of a graph:

- Let the graph have **n** vertices.
- Then, the adjacency matrix **A** is an n×n matrix.

### For an Undirected Graph:

- **A\[i]\[j] = 1** if there is an edge between vertex i and j.
- Otherwise, **A\[i]\[j] = 0**.
- The matrix is **symmetric** (A\[i]\[j] = A\[j]\[i]).

### For a Directed Graph:

- **A\[i]\[j] = 1** if there is an arc from vertex i to j.
- Otherwise, **A\[i]\[j] = 0**.
- The matrix is **not necessarily symmetric**.

### For a Weighted Graph:

- **A\[i]\[j] = w_ij** where **w_ij** is the weight of the edge or arc from i to j.
- **A\[i]\[j] = 0** if there is no edge/arc.

## Neighbours and Degree

### In Undirected Graphs:

- Node **v** has a **neighbour** u if (u, v) is an edge.
- **Neighbourhood N(v)**: Set of all neighbours of v.
- **Degree deg(v)**: Number of neighbours (edges incident on v).

### In Directed Graphs:

- **In-neighbour**: u is an in-neighbour of v if (u, v) is an arc.
- **Out-neighbour**: u is an out-neighbour if (v, u) is an arc.
- **In-degree deg⁻(v)**: Number of arcs coming into v.
- **Out-degree deg⁺(v)**: Number of arcs going out from v.

## Paths and Distance

### In Undirected Graphs:

- A **path**: A sequence of distinct nodes where each consecutive pair is connected by an edge.
- **Length of path**: Number of edges in it.
- **Distance between nodes u and v**: Length of the shortest path. If no path, distance is ∞.

### In Directed Graphs:

- A **directed path**: Sequence of nodes where each is connected by a directed arc to the next.
- **Length** and **distance** are defined the same way as above.

## Connectedness

### In Undirected Graphs:

- A graph is **connected** if there's a path between every pair of nodes.
- A **connected component** is a maximal set of nodes that are connected to each other.

### In Directed Graphs:

- A graph is **strongly connected** if there’s a directed path from every node to every other node.
- A **strongly connected component** is a maximal subset where all nodes are mutually reachable via directed paths.
