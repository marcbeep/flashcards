    "q": "What is the main idea of Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)?",
    "a": "- Describes how strategies evolve in populations over time\n- Based on biological concepts like selection and mutation\n- Interactions determine fitness, which drives reproduction"
  },
  {
    "q": "What are the core concepts of Evolutionary Game Theory?",
    "a": "- **Replicator Dynamics**: strategy growth based on fitness\n- **Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)**: resists invasion by other strategies\n- Models learning in populations rather than individuals"

    "q": "Explain the payoff matrix of the Prisoner's Dilemma.",
    "a": "- Two strategies: Cooperate (C) or Defect (D)\n- Payoff matrix:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n & C & D \\\\\n\\hline\nC & 3, 3 & 0, 5 \\\\\nD & 5, 0 & 1, 1\n\\end{array}\n\\]"

    "q": "How does fitness affect strategy evolution in EGT?",
    "a": "- Fitness is the average payoff from random interactions\n- Higher fitness = more likely to reproduce\n- Strategies with lower fitness decrease over time"

    "q": "What is the replicator dynamics equation and its intuition?",
    "a": "- Equation:\n\\[\n\\dot{x_i} = x_i (f_i(x) - \\bar{f}(x))\n\\]\n- \\(x_i\\): fraction playing strategy \\(i\\)\n- \\(f_i(x)\\): fitness of strategy \\(i\\)\n- \\(\\bar{f}(x)\\): average fitness\n- If a strategy does better than average, it grows"

    "a": "- Points where \\(\\dot{x_i} = 0\\) for all \\(i\\)\n- Can be:\n  - **Attractors** (stable)\n  - **Repellers** (unstable)\n  - **Saddle points** (partially stable)"

    "q": "How does the population evolve in the Prisoner's Dilemma?",
    "a": "- Defectors always get higher fitness\n- Cooperators decline over time\n- All-Defectors state is stable (ESS)"

    "q": "What is the difference between single and multi-population replicator dynamics?",
    "a": "- **Single**: one population interacts with itself\n- **Multi**: two distinct populations interact\n- Each population evolves based on the other's strategy distribution"

    "a": "- **Stag Hunt**: two stable pure strategies (coordination)\n- **Matching Pennies**: mixed NE, but strategy shares cycle forever"

    "q": "How is replicator dynamics connected to reinforcement learning?",
