## Swarm Intelligence Concepts

Swarm intelligence is the study of how simple agents (like ants, bees, robots) can work together to solve complex tasks. The key features include:

- **Decentralization**: No single controller.
- **Parallel search**: Many agents search at the same time.
- **Adaptivity**: Agents can adjust to changes.
- **Robustness**: The system still works even if some agents fail.

### Real-world Examples

- Network routing
- Dividing tasks and roles
- Transport and patrolling

## Foraging Task

This refers to how a group finds and collects items in an unknown area. It has two main parts:

1. **Path construction/planning**: Figuring out how to reach potential targets.
2. **Path exploitation/repair**: Using good paths repeatedly and fixing them if they stop working.

Different species use different techniques:

- **Ants**:

  - Explore randomly.
  - Leave **pheromones** that evaporate over time.
  - Other ants follow stronger pheromone trails.

- **Bees**:

  - Use **Lévy flights** for exploration.
  - Use **path integration** to track their way home.
  - **Dance** to tell others about food locations.

## Bee System (Bee-Inspired Foraging)

### Lévy Flight

- A search pattern that mixes **short local moves** with **occasional long jumps**.
- Helps bees (or robots) explore efficiently.

### Path Integration (PI)

- Bees keep track of **direction and distance** from their nest to food.
- This vector helps them return directly.

### Recruitment (Dancing)

- Bees **dance in the nest** to tell others about food.
- Dance direction = direction to food.
- Dance length = quality of food.
- Other bees use this to decide where to go.
- This is **autocatalytic**: more bees dance for better food, attracting even more.

## Swarm-Based Optimization Algorithms

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

- Inspired by bird flocking.
- Each "particle" adjusts its path using:

  - Its own experience.
  - Its neighbors' best-found position.

**Formula (simplified):**
Each particle updates its velocity and position based on:

- **Current velocity**
- **Distance to its best position**
- **Distance to the global best position**

Variables:

- **v** = velocity of the particle
- **x** = position of the particle
- **p_best** = best position found by the particle
- **g_best** = best position found by any particle

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

- Ants leave **pheromones** on paths they travel.
- More pheromones = more attractive the path.
- Pheromones **evaporate** over time to forget bad paths.
- Good paths are reinforced by repeated use.

## Swarm Robotics

This applies swarm ideas to groups of robots. The benefits:

- Work without a central control.
- Communicate only locally.
- Scalable and robust.

### Examples:

- **Firefly Synchronization**:

  - Fireflies sync their flashes by adjusting timing based on neighbors.
  - Robots mimic this for synchronized actions.

- **Bee-Inspired Foraging with Robots**:

  - Robots use:

    - Lévy flights for searching.
    - Path integration to track their movement.
    - Visual markers to identify nest and food.
    - Communication of PI vectors when they meet.

  - Used with **TurtleBots** (robots with limited sensors).

### Other Applications:

- Drone swarms (e.g. bridge inspection).
- Wireless sensor networks.
- Morphogenesis (forming shapes).
- Exploration, patrolling, anomaly detection.

Tool Example:

- **ARGoS**: A swarm simulator for testing swarm robot behaviors.

## Summary

Swarm intelligence uses natural strategies (from ants, bees, fireflies) to create smart, flexible, and robust systems. These ideas are used in:

- Optimization algorithms (like PSO and ACO).
- Robotics (swarm robots doing tasks together).
- Real-world problem solving (routing, search, inspection, etc.).
