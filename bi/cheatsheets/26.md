### **What is Swarm Intelligence?**

**Swarm Intelligence (SI)** refers to complex global behaviors that emerge from simple local interactions among individuals (agents) in a system. These agents follow basic rules and do not have knowledge of the global system.
→ Example: Ant colonies, bee hives, fish schools, bird flocks.

Key quote:

> “Swarm Intelligence is the complex global behavior shown by a distributed system that arises from the self-organized local interactions between its constituent agents.” – _Marco Dorigo_

### **Inspiration from Nature**

**Social Insects (especially ants):**

- Only \~2% of insects are social (e.g., ants, termites, some bees and wasps).
- Ants make up \~50% of all social insects.
- Ants’ total biomass ≈ human biomass.
- Ants exhibit specialized roles: harvesters, fungus growers, army ants, weavers, etc.
- Ants were arguably the **first farmers**.

**Bees:**

- Specialize in division of labor.
- Communicate food source location based on quality and distance.
- Maintain hive temperature through cooperation.

**Other Animals:**

- **Fish schools** and **bird flocks** also exhibit swarm behavior.
- Humans sometimes show similar behaviors (e.g., crowds, traffic).

### **Why Do Animals Swarm?**

Swarming behavior has clear benefits:

- **Energy savings**: e.g., geese flying in a V-formation reduce air resistance, increasing range by \~70% and allowing higher speed.
- **Protection**: confusion and safety in numbers against predators.
- **Hunting**: coordinated movement (e.g., tuna forming crescents to trap prey).

**Insight**: Individual animals don’t plan these outcomes. Instead, simple individual rules create useful **emergent group behaviors**.

### **How Do They Coordinate?**

**Key Mechanism: Self-Organization**

- A global pattern arises from local interactions.
- No central control.
- Based only on local information.

**Four Ingredients of Self-Organization:**

1. **Multiple interactions** – agents interact frequently.
2. **Randomness** – promotes exploration of new solutions.
3. **Positive feedback** – reinforces useful behavior (e.g., trail-following).
4. **Negative feedback** – prevents over-commitment (e.g., pheromone evaporation).

### **Main Features of Swarm Intelligence Systems**

- Parallel and distributed
- Stochastic (includes randomness)
- Adaptive to environment
- Use feedback mechanisms
- **Autocatalytic**: feedback loops that strengthen successful behavior (e.g., more ants → more pheromone → more ants)

### **Swarm as One Mind**

A swarm can behave like a **single intelligent organism**:

- Coordinated hunting, foraging, obstacle avoidance.
- Examples from ants, bees, locusts, birds.

### **Stigmergy: Indirect Communication**

**Stigmergy** = communication through the environment.
Instead of direct messaging:

- Individuals leave **markers** (e.g., pheromones).
- Others respond to these, adjusting their own behavior.
- The problem gets solved piece by piece by multiple individuals.

**In ants:**

- Lay pheromone trails.
- Stronger trails attract more ants.
- Evaporation balances the system.
- Leads to **autocatalytic reinforcement** of shorter paths (used in algorithms).

### **Example of Ant Behavior**

1. Ants follow a path to food.
2. Obstacle appears → they randomly explore.
3. Some find a shorter route.
4. That route is reinforced by pheromones.
5. Eventually, almost all ants take the shorter route.

This is the **biological basis for Ant Colony Optimization** algorithms.

### **Definition of Swarm Intelligence (again)**

> “Any attempt to design algorithms or distributed problem-solving devices inspired by the collective behavior of social insect colonies and other animal societies.”
> – _Bonabeau, Dorigo, Theraulaz (1999)_
