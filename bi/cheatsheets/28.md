## üêú Swarm Intelligence

Swarm Intelligence refers to the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. It's inspired by the way animals like ants, bees, or birds act together without central control to solve problems like:
  - Finding food
  - Organizing colonies
  - Navigating obstacles

Applications include:
  - Data clustering
  - Adaptive task allocation
  - Network routing
  - Robotics

## üßÆ Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

ACO is inspired by how real ants find the shortest path to food using pheromones. Pheromones are chemicals ants leave on their paths‚Äîstronger pheromones attract more ants, reinforcing good paths.

### Key Principles:

- **More pheromone = more ants follow the path**
- **Shorter paths are reinforced more quickly**
- This self-reinforcing loop helps converge to optimal or near-optimal paths

## üîÅ From Real Ants to Artificial Ants

### Artificial Ants:

- Move on a graph (like cities connected by roads)
- Choose next step based on:

  - Pheromone levels (œÑ·µ¢‚±º)
  - Heuristic information (Œ∑·µ¢‚±º), like 1/distance

- Keep track of:

  - Visited nodes
  - Cost (e.g., total distance)

After reaching the destination:

- They **retrace** their path and **update pheromones**
- **Better paths (shorter/cheaper)** get **more pheromone**

### Probability of Choosing a Path:

$P_{ij}(t) = \frac{[\tau_{ij}(t)]^\alpha \cdot [\eta_{ij}]^\beta}{\sum_{k \in J} [\tau_{ik}(t)]^\alpha \cdot [\eta_{ik}]^\beta}$

Where:

- $\tau_{ij}$ = pheromone on edge (i, j)
- $\eta_{ij}$ = heuristic info (e.g., 1/distance)
- $\alpha$, $\beta$ = parameters controlling influence of pheromone vs. heuristic
- J = set of unvisited nodes

## üîÑ Pheromone Update Rule

After all ants have completed their tours:

1. **Evaporation**: pheromone fades over time
   $\tau_{ij} \leftarrow (1 - \rho) \cdot \tau_{ij}$

   - $\rho$ = evaporation rate (between 0 and 1)

2. **Deposit**: better paths get more pheromone
   $\Delta \tau_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{m} \frac{1}{L_k}$

   - $L_k$ = path length of ant k

## üß™ Example: Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

### Problem:

- Visit all cities exactly once, return to start
- Minimize total travel distance

### How ACO solves TSP:

- Ants build tours probabilistically
- Remember visited cities to avoid repeats
- After tour, deposit pheromone based on tour quality (shorter = better)
- Pheromone evaporates over time to avoid premature convergence

### Example with 4 Cities (A, B, C, D):

- Ant randomly starts at a city
- Chooses next city based on pheromones and distances
- Completes tour, updates pheromones on edges used
- All pheromones decay a little
- Process repeats with other ants

## üîß The Ant System Algorithm (Dorigo et al., 1991)

Loop until stopping condition:

1. Place one ant at each city
2. Each ant builds a tour using probability rule
3. After all tours, update pheromone trails

---

## üõ† Modified ACO Variants

1. **Elitist Ant System (EAS)**: Best solution gets extra pheromone
2. **Rank-Based (ASrank)**: Top-ranked ants deposit pheromones, based on rank
3. **Max-Min AS (MMAS)**:

   - Only best ants update pheromone
   - Set upper/lower pheromone limits
   - Re-initialize trails if algorithm stagnates

4. **Ant Colony System (ACS)**:

   - Updates pheromones during tour construction (local update)
   - Emphasizes both exploration and exploitation
   - Local and global update rules

---

## üîÄ ACS Details

### State Transition Rule:

If random number $q \leq q_0$: **Exploitation**

- Choose best next city (max pheromone \* heuristic)

Else: **Exploration**

- Choose based on probability distribution:

$P_{ij} = \frac{[\tau_{ij}]^\alpha \cdot [\eta_{ij}]^\beta}{\sum_{k \in J} [\tau_{ik}]^\alpha \cdot [\eta_{ik}]^\beta}$

### Local Update Rule:

While building tour:
$\tau_{ij} \leftarrow (1 - \phi)\tau_{ij} + \phi\tau_0$

- $\phi$: decay rate, $\tau_0$: initial pheromone level

### Global Update Rule:

Only **best-so-far tour** gets updated:
$\tau_{ij} \leftarrow (1 - \rho)\tau_{ij} + \rho \Delta\tau_{ij}^{bs}$

- $\Delta\tau_{ij}^{bs} = 1/L_{bs}$ (best tour length)
